# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose - Explain the purpose of this analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to provide Louise insights so that she can set up her fundraising campaign in way that gives her a better chance of succeeding. 

## Analysis and Challenges

The analysis was performed by looking at past Kickstarter theatrical fundraising campaigns. The results were further narrowed down to campaigns that were either successful or unsuccesful based off of their launch date and fundraising goal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By the time July and August start to come around there appears to be a decline in the amount of campaigns meeting their fundraising goal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To determine the outcome a campaign, the ones reaching their goal were labeled "successful", while ones that did not were "unsucessful". There were no canceled campaigns.

- Campaigns with goals up to $5,000 have about a 75% of being successful.
- Campaigns between $5,000 to $25,000 have roughly a 50% chance of being successful 


-  The lower the campaign goal the better.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- The only challenge I ran into was no description for each column in the dataset. 

## Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- The time of year to start a campaign makes a big difference to the outcome. 
- Most successful theatrical campaigns are started in May or June.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Choosing a campaing with a goal of lower than $15,000 gives Louise a much higher chance of succeeding. If she could keep her goal below $5,000, she would really boost here chances.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
- There just aren't as many campagins with goals above $15,000 in the data.  It is not as easy to say with confidence, that just because the goals are higher, they are more likely to fail. 
- There isn't a lot of context in the data. There is a blurb section but nothing that gives you enough to determine any correlations. 
- There aren't details about the individual backers. 
- What do "staff_pick" and "spotlight" mean?

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

If you look further in the data, you see that all successful plays have TRUE in the "spotlight" column and all failed plays have FALSE.
